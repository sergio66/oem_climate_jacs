I've mentioned some of this before, but things get lost easily, in
slack.  So here are some relevant functions, from
/home/motteler/shome/airs_tiling

tile_loop1.m - this loops on all tiles; the outer loops are lat, lon,
               and the inner loop is on sets (time).  But the loops can be taken in
               any order.  It does a couple of data checks, but is mainly just an
               example of looping on tiles.

tile_index.m - tile lat/lon indices from lat/lon lists

tile_file.m - name and path for tile files, from lat/lon indices.
              Note that you can set the "tpre" parameter to generate your own names.

set2dlist.m - 16-day set number to datenum list

setspan.m - two 16-day set numbers spanning a year
